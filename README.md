# This project uses a standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into one of eight categories: airplane, car, cat, dog, flower, fruit, motorbike, and person. The model is implemented in projTEST456.py using TensorFlow and Keras.
# To run the project, ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed, along with TensorFlow 2.x and the required libraries, such as numpy and matplotlib. Clone the repository or download the project files, place the dataset in the appropriate directory, and update the dataset path in the script if necessary. Run the script using the command: python projTEST456.py
